## Hi, I'm [Abhilesh](https://abhilesh.github.io/) ðŸ‘‹

 - An Evolutionary Geneticist and a Bioinformatician developing analytical tools and pipelines.
 - Also a tech enthusiast with a keen interest in self-hosted applications.

Here's a fun display of my GitHub contributions made possible by the [snk GitHub action](https://github.com/Platane/snk).  
It's delightful watching Larry (the snake) gobble up my contribution tiles, while also motivating me to keep adding more fodder for Larry.
